### Network Analysis

Using [centrality measures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgUj8DEH5Tc), we analyse The Witcher Character Graph, that will allow to estimate how influential or significant a character is in the story.

#### Degree Centrality

This centrality measure the number of nodes a node is connected to versus the total it could possibly be connected to.
